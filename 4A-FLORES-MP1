### ``Computer Vision: ``
### ``   Simply put, computer vision (cv) is just like the human’s ability to perceive the physical world along with various things through the human eye’s lens and imagery. Though of course, the computer makes use of cameras and sensors to capture visual data instead of a literal eye.``

### ``   However, in the context of cv in the current world’s emerging technology, which is AI, it is basically considered as a subfield within AI that allows the computer to see, interpret and visualize. It's as if improving a human’s ability to see and process the data lying around but make it many more times better in terms of precision and speed. This is true for both image and video format.``

### `Computer Vision: Understanding Images`

### `Cv aims to extract and understand information just like we do, or simply put, to grasp meaning from images by recognizing objects, interpreting scenes, and identifying patterns. Unlike with image processing, the focus is more on the understanding of the content of said images rather than altering them.``

###  `Image Processing: Enhancing Visuals`

###   `Image processing is mostly focused on improving image quality, it can come in forms like by adjusting colors, enhancing contrast, or removing noise. It refines raw images into a better version in terms of being clearer, with more refined versions, making it finally more suitable for operating on or simply even just for analysis. This is most commonly utilized in the field of photography, medical and graphic design.`

### *Implemented code sample here
`import cv2`
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`# Loading image`
`image = cv2.imread('FaceRecognitionTrial.jpg')`

`# Convert to grayscale`
`gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`

`# Applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise`
`blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_image, (5, 5), 0)`

`# Applying Canny Edge Detection`
`edges = cv2.Canny(blurred_image, threshold1=100, threshold2=200)`

`# Displaying both original and with edge-detected images`
`plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))`

`plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)`
`plt.title('Original Image')`
`plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))`

`plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)`
`plt.title('Edge Detected Image')`
`plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')`
`plt.show()`

### Conclusion & Takeaways
### Importance of Image Processing in AI:

Effective image processing is crucial for AI systems, especially in applications like facial recognition and deepfakes. By enhancing image quality and extracting meaningful data, image processing ensures AI systems can interpret visual information accurately. It transforms raw data into actionable insights, improving precision in tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and recognition.

### Learning Reflections:

Through this activity, it became clear that fundamental image processing techniques, 
such as edge detection, play a crucial role in addressing real-world AI challenges. 

The exploration demonstrated how improving the quality of visual data enhances the reliability of AI systems, 
particularly in applications like facial recognition and combating deepfake manipulation. 
Image processing serves as the essential link between raw visual inputs and intelligent interpretation by AI systems.

### Extension:
#### Transfer Learning:Newer/emerging technique in image processing

### Concept
Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model, which has been trained on a large dataset, and fine-tuning it for a specific task. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired, reducing the need for extensive computational resources and large amounts of data.

### How it Works:
> Pre-trained Models: These models are typically trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which contains millions of images across thousands of categories. 
> Feature Extraction: The pre-trained model’s layers act as feature extractors. For a new task, the final layers of the model are replaced with layers specific to the new task.
> Fine-Tuning: The modified model is then fine-tuned on the new dataset. This involves training the new layers while optionally adjusting the weights of the pre-trained layers.

### Benefits
It reduces training time by using pre-learned features, improves performance, especially with small or similar datasets, and saves computational resources, making it accessible for smaller projects. It's widely used in applications like medical imaging for tumor detection, autonomous vehicles for object detection, and natural language processing for tasks like sentiment analysis.
